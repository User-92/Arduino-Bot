# Arduino Bot
Code for a video I made on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUsoZbVyc2c

## How to run:

Download the code, open main.py and change where it says "PUT ARDUINO PATH HERE" to the path that your arduino is located at
If you don't know how to find your Arduino path, you can try this: https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/arduinoio/ug/find-arduino-port-on-windows-mac-and-linux.html
Now you want to go to the last line of main.py and put your bot token where it says "BOT TOKEN"
Save that file

Now you should be set up, so plug in your Arduino, upload the code in arduino-bot.ino to the arduino
and run main.py with `python main.py`

## Requirements

```
discord.py
pyserial
```

Install with `pip install` with the package name after.
